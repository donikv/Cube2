## Description

Cube2 is a large multi illuminant dataset composed of XXX outdoor and indoor images. 
These images were collected using 3 different DSLR camera models and in different times during the day and in different times of the year. 
Images were mostly collected in Croatia, and feature mostly urban scenes. 
Indoor images were collected and annotated using a variation of method for dataset collection described in the paper by [Beigpour et al.](http://www.cat.uab.cat/Public/Publications/2014/BRV2014/TIP_2014.pdf)
Outdoor images were annotated manually. In addition to the spatial map of illuminants for each image, the groundtruth color of the illuminants is provided.
The color of the illuminants was retrieved from the SpyderCube calibration objects that were placed in each scene.
